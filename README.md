## üîç The vSNP3 Advantage: Two-Step Process Explained

### Why Two Steps Are Better Than One

Most SNP callers force you to reprocess all your samples each time you add new ones. vSNP3's two-step approach is different:

1. **Step 1: Process Alignment Once** - Align reads and call SNPs for each sample individually
2. **Step 2: Combine and run VCF files** - Generate matrices and trees from any combination of samples

</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/img/step2_file_structure.png" alt="Step 2 output" width="550"/>
</p>

This approach lets you:
- Add new samples to your analysis without reprocessing existing ones
- Create different sample groupings for different investigations
- Save computational resources and time
- Maintain a growing, curated database of SNP profiles

### Defining SNPs: Sample Classification

A unique feature of vSNP3 is its use of defining SNPs to automatically categorize samples:

```
Full Dataset (100 samples)
   ‚îÇ
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Group A (40 samples) - Defining SNP: position 123456 = T
   ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ
   ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Subgroup A1 (15 samples) - Defining SNP: position 234567 = G
   ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ
   ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Subgroup A2 (25 samples) - Defining SNP: position 234567 = A
   ‚îÇ
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Group B (60 samples) - Defining SNP: position 123456 = C
        ‚îÇ
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Subgroup B1 (20 samples) - Defining SNP: position 345678 = T
        ‚îÇ
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Subgroup B2 (40 samples) - Defining SNP: position 345678 = C
```

Benefits of defining SNPs:
- **Automatic Grouping**: Samples are classified into groups based on specific SNP patterns
- **Focused Analysis**: Quickly drill down to specific subsets of related samples
- **Computational Efficiency**: Reduce analysis time by working with smaller, relevant sample sets

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
conda create -c conda-forge -c bioconda -n vsnp3 vsnp3=3.30
conda activate vsnp3
```

For detailed setup instructions, see [conda instructions](./docs/instructions/conda_instructions.md).

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Verify installation
vsnp3_step1.py -h
vsnp3_step2.py -h
```
```bash
# Download test dataset and add reference types
cd ${HOME}
git clone https://github.com/USDA-VS/vsnp3_test_dataset.git
cd vsnp3_test_dataset/vsnp_dependencies
vsnp3_path_adder.py -d $(pwd)
```
```bash
# Run Step 1: Process a single sample (only needed once per sample)
cd ~/vsnp3_test_dataset/AF2122_test_files/step1
vsnp3_step1.py -r1 *_R1*.fastq.gz -r2 *_R2*.fastq.gz -t Mycobacterium_AF2122
```
Step 2 uses the _zc.vcf file from step 1 which contains positions with no coverage.  Your step 2 VCF database should be built with these _zc.vcf files.
```bash
# Run Step 2: Generate SNP matrix and tree (can be run with any sample combination)
cd ~/vsnp3_test_dataset/AF2122_test_files/step2
vsnp3_step2.py -a -t Mycobacterium_AF2122
```

## üìä Real-World Example: Building Your Surveillance Database

Imagine you're tracking a bacterial outbreak over time:

1. **Initial Investigation**: Process your first 10 samples through Step 1, then use Step 2 to generate a phylogenetic tree
2. **New Sample Analysis**: When you receive 5 new samples, only run Step 1 on these new samples
3. **Updated Results**: Run Step 2 again using all 15 samples to see how the new samples relate to the existing ones
4. **Focused Investigation**: Use defining SNPs to identify a specific cluster, then create a detailed analysis with just those samples

This workflow saves time and resources while maintaining a comprehensive database of all processed samples.

## üìò Key Features in Detail

### Step 1: Alignment and SNP Calling

Step 1 processes raw sequencing data for each sample individually:

- Aligns reads to your reference genome
- Calls high-quality SNPs
- Tracks regions with zero coverage
- Generates comprehensive quality metrics
- Automatically assigns samples to groups based on defining SNPs

Sample output metrics:

### Using Defining SNPs

vSNP3's defining SNP capability allows you to:

- Automatically classify samples into hierarchical groups
- Focus your analysis on biologically relevant sample subsets
- Quickly identify related samples in an outbreak scenario
- Build a labeled sample database

## üß¨ Understanding Defining SNPs

One of vSNP3's most powerful features is its ability to automatically classify samples using defining SNPs. Each reference type has its own defining SNP Excel file that defines these critical positions.

### Locating Your Defining SNP Files

After installation, you can find the path to your defining SNP files with:

```bash
vsnp3_path_adder.py -s
```

This will show all installed reference types and their associated file paths.

### Anatomy of a Defining SNP File

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/img/defining_snps_example.png" alt="Defining SNPs Excel Structure" width="800"/>
</p>

The defining SNP Excel file has a structured format:

1. **Row 1**: Contains chromosome:position identifiers for each SNP position
2. **Row 2**: Names of each group/subgroup (e.g., Mbovis-All, Mbovis-01, Mbovis-01A)
3. **Remaining Rows**: Positions to be filtered from the analysis for each specific group

When vSNP3 analyzes a sample:
- It checks the sample's nucleotides at each defining position
- Based on the SNP pattern, it automatically assigns the sample to the appropriate group
- During analysis, it filters out the problematic positions listed below each group's column

### Customizing Your Analysis

The beauty of this system is its flexibility:
- You can define hierarchical groups based on evolutionary relationships
- Each group can have its own set of filtered positions to improve analysis quality
- As you discover new lineages, you can update the defining SNP file to reflect them

This classification system allows you to:
- Automatically organize samples as they're processed
- Focus your analysis on specific groups of interest
- Maintain consistent classifications across your entire database
- Filter out positions known to be problematic for specific lineages

The defining SNP system transforms vSNP3 from a simple SNP caller into an intelligent analysis platform that grows more valuable as your sample database expands.

## üß∞ Reference Types

Reference types have key files that provide structure to your analysis:
- **Defining filter file**: Identifies group-specific SNPs
- **Metadata file**: Maps sample names
- **FASTA reference**: For read alignment
- **GenBank file**: For annotation

Adding a reference is simple:
```bash
vsnp3_path_adder.py -d /path/to/reference_files
```

Reference types are called based on their directory names once their parent directory is added.

## üîÑ Setting Up Reference Types

One of the most important first steps in using vSNP3 is setting up your reference types. This only needs to be done once, and it enables all the powerful features of vSNP3 including automatic sample classification and group-specific filtering.  Reference types are called based on their directory names once their **parent directory** is added.

### What Is a Reference Type?

A reference type in vSNP3 is a collection of files for a specific organism that includes:
- A reference genome (FASTA)
- Annotation information (GenBank)
- Defining SNP positions (Excel file)
- Sample name mapping (Excel file)

These files work together to provide the foundation for your analyses.

### Adding Your First Reference Type

Adding a reference type is simple using the `vsnp3_path_adder.py` utility:

Parent directory contains the reference directory.  This parent directory may contain many reference types, each a separate subfolder.

```bash
# Add a reference parent directory containing all necessary files.  
vsnp3_path_adder.py -d /path/to/parent_dictory
```

This command tells vSNP3 where to find the reference files for a particular organism. The reference type name is taken directly from the directory name. For example, if your files are in a directory called `Mycobacterium_AF2122`, that becomes the reference type name you'll use in your commands.

### Example Reference Type Setup

Let's walk through a complete example:

1. **Prepare your reference directory**
   
   Create a directory with these files:
   ```
   Parent_Directory/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄMycobacterium_AF2122/
         ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ defining_filter.xlsx    # Contains defining SNPs and filter positions
         ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metadata.xlsx           # Sample name mapping
         ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AF2122.fasta            # Reference genome
         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AF2122.gbk              # GenBank annotation file
   ```

2. **Add the reference type to vSNP3**
   ```bash
   vsnp3_path_adder.py -d /path/to/Parent_Directory
   ```

3. **Verify the reference was added**
   ```bash
   vsnp3_path_adder.py -s
   ```
   
   You should see your reference type listed, along with paths to all associated files.

### Managing Multiple Reference Types

vSNP3 allows you to work with multiple reference types:

- **Adding additional references**: Simply run the path adder for each new reference
  ```bash
  vsnp3_path_adder.py -d /path/to/another_parent_directory
  ```

- **Viewing all references**: Check which references are available
  ```bash
  vsnp3_path_adder.py -s
  ```

### Best Practices for Reference Management

- **Organize by organism**: Keep reference files for each organism in separate directories
- **Use descriptive names**: Choose reference type names that clearly identify the organism
- **Keep references consistent**: Use the same reference across all related analyses
- **Back up your reference files**: Save your defining SNP files especially, as they contain valuable classification information

By properly setting up your reference types, you're creating a foundation for consistent, repeatable analyses that grow more valuable as your sample database expands.
